# CommunicatorServer
Copy of a backend for the university project. 
The goal was to create a real-time chat application similar to WhatsApp. 
The app allowed users to create both private and group chat rooms, exchange messages, and share files and images.

This project uses:
- WebSockets for real-time communication
- JPA for database management
- REST API architecture to integrate with a React Native mobile app
- Custom JWT authentication for user verification
- Documentation in the form of Javadoc + UML
  
Server side was written together with https://github.com/radekgrzywacz
